                Hey there! I’m a third-year student, soon to be a deployed product of engineering. <span class="hero__highlight">I speak binary like it’s my first language</span>—yep, I’m that guy who gets machines to do what I want. 
                I love messing around with code and building things that make people go, <span class="hero__highlight">“Whoa, that’s dope!”.</span> I'm the guy who turns <span class="hero__highlight">"what if"</span> ideas into mad-engineered realities.
                <span class="hero__highlight">I’m all about picking up new skills fast.</span> Throw me something new, and I’ll figure it out and put it to work, no sweat. 
                But I’m not just a geek. I’m down for raging movie debates, if you wanna argue over whether Back to the Future beats Star Wars? I’m game. <span class="hero__highlight">I've also got a serious filmmaking bug.</span> Catch me storyboarding a short film or geeking out over camera angles. Oh, and I love having people around, cracking jokes, and eating way too much food with friends.
                <span class="hero__highlight">To my fellow internet explorers:</span> Glad you’re here! Poke around, enjoy the chaos of my projects, and maybe get inspired. 
                <span class="hero__highlight">To my fellow recruiters sneaking a peek at this:</span> You're missing an engineer who brings skills and laughs on the table. I won't disappoint. <span class="hero__highlight">Hire Me.</span>
